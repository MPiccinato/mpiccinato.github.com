    <p>Hello and thanks for stopping by.</p>
    <p>I am a developer and I love creating web based apps.</p>
    <p>My most current adventure is <a href="http://www.hadthatbeer.com">Had That Beer</a>.  A place to keep track of which beers you have tried.  I created it so I could...keep track of what I have tried.</p>

    <h3>On the Internets</h3>
    <p>You can find me on Twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mpiccinato">@MPiccinato.</a></p>
    <p>I post fun things I find on the internet on tumblr <a href="http://mpiccinato.tumblr.com">mpiccinato.tumblr.com</a></p>
    <p>And sometimes I will post a few pictures up on Flickr <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpiccinato/">flickr.com/photos/mpiccinato/</a></p>
