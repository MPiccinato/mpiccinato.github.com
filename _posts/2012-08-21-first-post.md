summary: New habits.

This site has be redesigned more times than posts written. Getting in the habit of writing has always been hard for me. I write plenty of things down from the ideas of things to write about to just ideas for new apps. These are always single sentences or a collection of bullet points describing the idea.  Those ideas or thoughts then just keep to themselves.

I am mostly scared of voicing my opinion on things I am unsure of, something I might think I have thought all the way through on but might have missed something.  I am also just scared of writing, it is something I haven't never been all that great at.

However, I am ready to try and change that.
