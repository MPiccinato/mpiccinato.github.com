This site has be redesigned more times than posts written. Getting in the habit of writing has always been hard for me. I collect plenty of things to write about, from stories to blog posts, but they always only get as far as a few bullet points.

So what keeps me from writting? I constantly tell myself I am not good at it so don't bother. And more importantly, I don't put forth the effort to make myself any bettr at it.

But why do I do this? Am I really that bad? I don't want to be. But then where is my effort? Lost in all the other things I feel I have to get done in the day? Of course it is since I constantly do not make it a priority.
