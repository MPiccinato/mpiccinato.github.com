<p> Here are a few web apps that I run.</p>

<p>I didn't really like any of the available beer sites for just keeping track of what I had tasted so I decided to create my own.</p>

<h3>Faveone</h3>

<p>This was a weekend project that was originally intended to just checkout Codeigniter.  It has turned into a fun time waster and a conversation starter.</p>
